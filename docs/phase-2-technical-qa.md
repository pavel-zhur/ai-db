# Phase 2 Technical Q&A - Integration and Completion Plan

This document captures questions to clarify requirements and guide the integration of all AI-DB components into a working POC.

(my note to AI: please read my answers and agree/disagree, think if you can suggest better options somewhere, tell me about the drawbacks of the chosen options)

## System Architecture & Integration

### Q1: What is the intended deployment architecture?
Should all components run as separate processes/services, or should some be embedded/combined? For example:
- Should the MCP servers run as standalone processes or be embedded in the Console?
- Should there be a single API server that hosts both AI-DB and AI-Frontend endpoints?
- What is the expected process topology in production?

**Answer:** 

Unless you think otherwise, here's what I'm thinking (but please let me know if you have a better idea):

- ai-db should be a library, always running inside any host program, like the sqlite library. it requires a config, like the ai tokens, maybe some configurable instructions (or paths to instructions files, I'm not sure about that, maybe not, maybe not, generally - whats the best practice for python libraries like this), it requires a wrapper transaction, because its sole responsibility is to do one operation. the transaction would provide the files folder path to the lib. probably I'm thinking the caller would wrap a call or a series of calls in `with tran = gitsmt.tran..`. the caller would configure this library, git tran library, and whatever else they need to configure. they would use the git library directly too. there's a reverse option where this library fully uses the git library internally, but ai-frontend will need to do that too, and I'm afraid it's not as complex, and also it wont allow the users to manage transactions so efficiently and may cause code duplication. so it seems they need to create a transaction and inside it use ai-db. (or ai-frontend inside frontend transactions; those will likely be separate repos, unless you think there are no issues with that). ai-db may be used with or without the ai-frontend. it's possible that some project use only ai-db without the frontend. or possible some projects will use them together. console and mcp are two examples of projects using ai-db (with/without frontend, doesn't matter). and in the future (not right now) we definitely need to have the third - a visual designer for managing uis and for having web interface for chats. like a web console + preview of ui + preview of data via ui. but for now, console and manual browsing will be enough for poc.

- ai-frontend is basically a similar generation/migrations library of static frontends. just like ai-db is a simple generation/migrations library of data. used very similarly, I hope.

- something will need to host the static frontends. probably a docker container, some nginx. I'll use one instance in our poc, no multi-tenancy. however the libraries should of course be able to work in multi-tenant environments. I'm talking about git, db, frontend libraries. need multiple tenants? instantiate services with multiple configs. something like that.

- mcp and console are completely separate and independent from each other. console is like cli. mcp server is a server, no cli. best practices for cli and best practices for mcp servers.

- ai-frontend endpoints are, basically, ai-db. because ai-frontend is hosted statically (nginx in docker?), and it calls an api hosting the ai-db. the chat (neither text nor voice) feature in the frontend is not included in the current poc, it's for future (include it in the root readme.md please). hence the frontend will be read-only + maybe forms that make update operations. updates to schema, updates to frontend - via console or mcp. updates to data - also via console or mcp, or via rigid forms on the ui (generated by claude-code called from ai-frontend calling the ai-db).

I'm not sure in all these thoughts. correct me if you have better ideas or ask more questions if you have.

another piece of detail: you're currently running in a dev container, vs code dev container. you should be able to run tests, integration tests, everything - inside your dev container. you can use nested containers for that if you want, but it won't be easy for you, claude code. on the other hand, you may like to isolate environments of the 5 components. maybe it's easier for you to run nested docker. or maybe it's easier for you to have 5 separate venvs and work with one at a time and run tests. but generally I'd prefer docker-compose files which I could run from my host machine - for tests, for work, for different purposes. for automated tests, manual tests. you may use docker-in-docker if you think that's the best approach. but please no workarounds, only best practices. think how you'll install and test all of that, I need you to be able to do it automatically.

**AI Feedback:** I agree with the library approach for ai-db/ai-frontend. This follows the SQLite model and provides maximum flexibility. Key benefits:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusability across different host applications
- Transaction management at the caller level prevents duplication

**Potential challenges:**
- Configuration management across libraries (consider using pydantic settings)
- Ensuring consistent transaction usage patterns (good documentation crucial)
- Testing complexity with multiple integration points

**User Response:**:
agreed, lets use pydantic if you think it's a common practice for libraries. for python libraries. libraries.

### Q2: What is the primary user interaction flow?
Walk me through the intended user experience from start to finish:
1. User starts the Console - then what?
they say, init an empty db in that folder (it'll be an empty git repo. it'll be able to contain db files and frontend files, they need to be able to be in sync. in separate folders inside the repo, of course. and not necessarily will create any init frontend be created until the frontend is first called, because tehre's a use case of using the ai0db only, without the frontend).
then they start modifying the schema, executing queries. they may ask for existing schema. any modifications wrapped in transactions, explicit commits or rollbacks. failures dont rollback the tran, but are not stored in the branch (not committed and dont actually modify files... in case of db. in case of frontend, modifications are needed, but they need to be reverted by the git lib when it notices an error). then they commit. thats all. frontend hosting or knowing its url is not the responsibility of the console.

regarding both frontend files and db files stored in different folders in the same repo: I think the git layer should also support a frontend files cleanup operation, a db files cleanup (as in theory we could want to run frontend without db, probably a db from a diffefrent repository... think about decoupling, I'd like these components to be usable independently when needed), cleanups can be called from console or from mcp. inits (opposite to cleanups) will be called by respective libraries (db, frontend).
2. How do they connect to a database?
by specifying the path to the repo in the config
3. How do they generate a frontend?
by choosing a function - generate a frontend :) need to think what happens when generation fails, it fails with an error "missing info" or "unresolvede questions, unable to make big assumptions" - they'll continue the dialog and the frontend lib funvtion will be called again. however the frontend lib doesnt maintain the context. its call requires everything as a parameter. so that dialog will be maintained by the console, and it'll supply the needed (only sufficnent) context to the frontend lib. proabbly the context of calling one frontend func.
4. How do they interact with the generated frontend?
via browser. it's hosted by nginx from docker-compose.

**Answer:** 

**AI Feedback:** Good flow. The transaction-wrapped operations with explicit commits/rollbacks is clean. Storing both DB and frontend in same repo enables atomic updates across both layers - smart for maintaining consistency.

### Q3: What is the relationship between Console and MCP servers?

**Answer:** 
The Console seems to duplicate functionality that MCP servers provide. Should:
- Console use MCP servers internally for all operations?
I'd rather console be totally independent in this poc. mcps are not designed for consoles, they're designed for ai models, right? btw, make sure mcp can provide really all the information about db and about frontend, especially the schemas and semantic descriptions. that's vital for the mcp. I can then connect with copilot to it and fully manage. I should be able to manage everything via mcp. in terms of.... when it comes to any commitable data to files.
- Console have direct access to AI-DB/AI-Frontend libraries?
yep
- MCP servers be optional or required?
people wont use mcp if they don't need to, they'll use console if we're talking about this poc. or build their own apps and import the three libs.

## API Server Requirements (Critical Gap)

### Q4: What should the API server provide?
The missing API server is a critical blocker. What endpoints/functionality should it expose:
- REST vs GraphQL vs both?
- Authentication/authorization approach?
- Should it handle both data queries AND frontend generation requests?
- Real-time features (WebSockets for transactions/updates)?
**Answer:** 

whatever's sufficient for the frontend. I don't think it's good for the frontend to call the mcp, we could, but I'm not sure it's convenient. if it's convenient - the mcp server may act as an ai-db api. but if architecturally you think it's not convenient or good for any reason, it's better to have a separate ai-db api. no auth, only data queries, no frontend generation requests, no realtime features in the poc. rest or graphql - hmmm.... rest. but remember, the input query is a free text, so when you ask rest or graphql - from requests perspective the frontend may send even LDAP requests, it doesn't matter. responses will be in json, it's best for react I think. and their schema will be fully equal to the advertised schema the frontend expects, was built in reference to.

### Q5: How should the API server handle transactions?
Given the git-layer transaction model:
- Should the API maintain transaction state across HTTP requests?
- Use session-based transactions or transaction IDs?
- How to handle transaction timeouts/cleanup?

**Answer:** 

the api server: for those rare db update requests (not schema changes), each call is wrapped in implicit transaction. so.. no transaction handling from the frontend. each call gets committed immediatley. in this poc.

### Q6: Should generated frontends connect directly to the API or through a proxy?
- Direct connection means frontends need CORS configuration
- Proxy could provide additional security/transformation
- How to handle authentication tokens in generated frontends?

**Answer:** 

what's best practice for us? for our arch & deployment models?

oh, by the way - I do need azure devops pipeline that runs all tests. (all tests that dont require AI tokens ;) there should be no other tests). try to keep tests simple if you can, don't go too crazy. oh, each proj should have its own independent tests. probably some integration tests in the console and mcp, but still no real ai tokens usage.

**AI Feedback:** For POC, direct connection with CORS is simplest. Use environment variable for API URL in frontend builds. For production later, consider reverse proxy for:
- Single domain (avoids CORS)
- SSL termination
- Request routing
- Rate limiting

**User Response:**:
lets use cors config in ai-frontend-api

## Data Model & Schema Management

### Q7: What is the canonical schema format?
AI-DB uses one format, AI-Frontend expects another. Should we:
- Standardize on JSON Schema everywhere?
- Create adapters between formats?
- Have a unified schema service?

**Answer:** 

maybe standardize on json schema. but honestly, I'd prefer it kept in yaml in files - yaml is better readable. do I understand correctly there's the well-known json schema format, kind of universal and popular? there are existing libraries validating it, it's well known to all uis. probably typescript can be generated following that format (the models) if needed. and even python files can be generated. or at least it's universally understood. lets talk about it before making any decisions - what would it take to use that format but store it yaml at least in the files? and between the libraries I'm assuming it would be passed as dicts/lists/nested structures. lets talk about it before making any decisions, I'm not certain here.

**AI Feedback:** Yes! JSON Schema is the standard (json-schema.org). Perfect solution:
- Store as YAML files (human-readable)
- Use JSON Schema structure (universal)
- Pass as Python dicts between components
- Libraries exist: jsonschema (Python), ajv (JS)
- TypeScript generation: json-schema-to-typescript
- Supports validation, documentation, constraints

This gives us best of both worlds - readability + standards.

### Q8: How should schema evolution work?
- Can users modify schemas through natural language?
yes
- How to handle breaking changes?
ai will do its best. and will return success but partial data loss result, and a comment. basically, it's only the AI that handles migrations.
- Should we version schemas?
the git layer kind of versions it. I don't think we need explicit versioning in ai-db or ai-frontend. not for now, not in the poc.
- Migration strategy?

**AI Concern - Version Mismatch**: Git versioning ≠ API versioning. Problems will occur when:
- Frontend generated for schema v1 calls API serving schema v2
- No way to detect incompatibility until runtime errors
- Users can't tell which frontend version matches which schema

**Minimal solution**: Add `schema_version` field (timestamp or counter) that frontend can check on startup.

**User Response:**:
no, lets not have schema versions now. it's complicated

**Answer:** 
see above

### Q9: What constitutes a "database" in this system?
- Is it a Git repository?
- A directory of YAML files?
- A namespace within a larger repository?
- How to handle multiple databases?

**Answer:** 

a database is a folder in the git repo. a folder of yaml files.
on the other hand, a database is a git repo. (it may be colocated in the repo with the fronend files).

I think one instance of the ai-db service works with one "database". I think a git repository for now may contain just one database. (and/or one frontend config files). generally you can implement code that doesn't enforce a constraint that the frontend and the database living in the same repository have to be connected somehow. let's leave freedom and flexibility, and assume usually the apps using our libs (using frontend and db) will just implement it correctly - instantiate and provide config to the git-layer lib, instantiate and provide config and a transaction to the ai-db lib, etc. the users will take care of the correspondence and the ui and the db being in sync.

git-layer should not support multiple databases. the ai-db works with just ine db in one transaction. ai-frontend, one frontend, works with one db only. which one - depends on the configuration. console will kind do it the way that the frontend and the db files live in the same repo, but I think it's just at the console level, the console being merely an example of one of possible usage patterns. other then that, it's totally flexible.

does it all make sense?

ai-db merely receives a foler on disk from the transaction. ai-frontend receives a folder too. git-layer handles versioning and cleanup of changes on errors and commits and merges, ai-db and ai-frontend just work with files in a given folder and dont care about transactions. as long as the user uses the "with" pattern, nothing may break.

**AI Concern - Deployment Coupling**: Storing DB and frontend in same repo couples their deployment:
- Can't scale frontend independently from DB
- Frontend changes create DB version bumps
- Can't have multiple frontends for one DB
- Deployment rollbacks affect both layers

**Consider**: Document how to use separate repos as an option, even if combined is the default.

**User Response:**:
agreed, lets document how to use separate repos as an option. there should be no contraint that they should be together or require one another.

## Security & Permissions

### Q10: How should authentication work across components?
- Single sign-on across Console/API/Frontend?
- API keys vs JWT tokens?
- How to handle service-to-service auth (e.g., MCP to AI-DB)?

**Answer:** 
for now, no auth in the poc.

**AI Concern - Security Risk**: Even for POC, a completely open API that can modify data is dangerous:
- Accidental scripts pointing to wrong instance
- Port scanning bots finding and corrupting data
- No audit trail of who made changes

**Minimal protection**: Add single API_KEY environment variable check. One line: `if request.headers.get('X-API-Key') != API_KEY: abort(401)`

**User Response:**:
no

### Q11: How granular should permissions be?
Current model has select/data_modify/schema_modify/view_modify. Should we:
- Add row-level security?
- Column-level permissions?
- Operation-specific permissions (e.g., can create tables but not drop)?

**Answer:** 

current model is enough.

### Q12: How to handle multi-tenancy?
- Separate Git repos per tenant?
- Namespace within shared repo?
- How to ensure data isolation?

**Answer:** 

separate git repos. but honestly, in case for some reason a user would like to colocate multiple dbs in one git repo, why dont they do so by supplying a config with the folder names corresponding to each repo. it could be a config parameter of the git layer service. certainly, thread-unsafe, single thread assumed. but I'm not sure why it could be needed. maybe not in the poc. but lets do it, its not complex.

## User Experience & Workflows

### Q13: Should generated frontends be editable?
- One-time generation vs iterative refinement?
- How to preserve custom modifications?
- Version control for frontend code?

**Answer:** 

suuuure, they should be editable, absolutely. thats why the ai-frontend service accepts a transaction! frontend files are stored in the git repo just like ai-db files. ai-db wont cleanup (undo its changes (untracked/changed files)) on failure, git-layer should. (because claude code may sometimes leave files with errors and say it's unable to fix them). so git-layer will cleanup. just like it should cleanup the ai-db changes on error. I think ai-db may already be cleaning them up (or, to be more specific, it will not save changes unless it validates them), but regardless - the git-layer should clean them up on error regardless of whether it's the ai-db or ai-frontend. ideally, why don't we make it so that the git repo doesn't even know if it's a repo for the frontend or for the db. can we make it so abstract? I think this knowledge isnt needed. probably it's needed for init operations only. probably it should know. but.. very simply and minimally. and enforce no constraints and the behavior should be identical. code that handles db or frontend uniformally.

the behavior is:
- they use "with transaction" syntax
- git repo assumes it's a readonly transaction and just provides the location of the current working copy (the folder (frontend or db) in it) (unless it's said in the transaction-starting method that it's a writable transaction)
- ai-db or ai-frontend operations run within the transaction
- if ai-db or ai-frontend have an intent to update files, they should call the update intent method (cant remember the name). if it's already a writable transaction, the git repo has already prepared a separate folder on disk with a temp checkout of a new branch. if not yet, then it does so on that call. and the path provided by the transaction changes to the new temp path.
- for each operation, when it succeeds, the git-layer commits the change
- for each operation, when it fails (there's an error), git-layer cleans up any modifications in the working copy, and stays in that branch.
- if rollback, git does nothing. basically deletes that folder, maybe pushes changes to the main folder, but not to the main branch. that branch remains. forever in history.
- if commit, that branch is merged to main.

I'm assuming we'll have a folder on disk or a remote git server. as a repository. and we'll have local checkouts for writable transactions. and the permanent main local checkout, of the main branch, always corresponding to the latest state.

do you think it's a working model?

how the git-layer knows an operation succeeded? well, ai-db and ai-frontend should call some method on success. so the git-layer knows it needs to commit. (but not merge yet).

**AI Concern - Lost Debugging Info**: When git-layer "cleans up any modifications", developers lose critical debugging information. When Claude Code generates invalid TypeScript, we need to see what was attempted.

**Better approach**:
- Keep failed changes in the branch (as you mentioned)
- Name branches clearly: `failed-transaction-{timestamp}-{operation}`
- Add debug log of what was attempted and why it failed
- Consider git stash for quick recovery attempts

**User Response:**:
cool, lets do it! branch naming and keeping in the branch (new branch), and then switching to the old transaction branch, which will cleanup altomatically. git stash I think not needed. ai-db and ai-frontend should make attempts to recover without calling any git operations. I don't want them to assume git is there at all.

btw, they should be tested without the real git! their operations just work with the folder provided by the transaction. a reansaction could also be instantiated manually by the test code and have no git logic underneath. it could be a simple folder, not a git working copy. they're totally independent from git features in the context of their actions.

### Q14: How to handle long-running operations?
- Query compilation might take time
- Frontend generation is slow
- Show progress? Allow cancellation?
- Background job queue?

**Answer:** 

for now, lets make it very simple and not worry about it. in the phase 3 we'll make dialog, refinements, progress, but that's later. thats too complex. for now - one call (to db or to frontend) is one operation. if it's a read operation, it returns data and the plan and the schema. if it's a read operation given the plan, it executes immediately, no AI involved. the frontend calling the DB will also pass such plans. or call views (which is basically a compiled plan stored in the DB, + semantic info stored in the db for it).

ai-db certainly validates that the data it returns adheres to the schema, and raises error otherwise.

**AI Concern - User Experience**: Without progress feedback, users will:
- Think 5+ minute frontend generation is frozen
- Kill the process mid-operation, corrupting state
- Retry operations that are actually still running

**Minimal fix**: Print timestamped "Still working..." every 30 seconds. Simple while effective.

**User Response:**:
ok, every 30 seconds lets print it. as long as connection is alive (frontend) or as long as console waits for the method return. if frontend loses connection, it shows a connection error of course. or if operation fails of course.

### Q15: What development workflow do you envision?
- Local development setup?
- Hot reload for frontends?
- Database seeding/fixtures?
- Testing approach?

**Answer:** 

local development setup, in-docker local setup, probably docker-in-docker approach for you for teating. no seending, no hot reload. if fixtures are needed, they're easy to do. you can make a method of the repository to init the repository and put seed data in there (provided as a path to a folder). that's possible.

## Transaction Model Clarification

### Q16: What exactly should transactions guarantee?
- ACID properties - which ones apply?
- Isolation level (read committed, repeatable read, serializable)?
- How to handle conflicts between concurrent transactions?

**Answer:** 

no concurrent transactions. reads happen from main (unless they're in a writable transaction already), hence reads can go concurrently. but only one update transaction at a time. unless it's committed, reads dont get the info. so.. read committed. probably. with some serializable features :)

### Q17: Should transactions span both data and schema changes?
- Can I CREATE TABLE and INSERT in same transaction?
- Rollback of schema changes?
- Frontend generation within transactions?

**Answer:** 
yes, yes, yes

## Performance & Scalability

### Q18: What are the performance targets?
- Query response time expectations?
- Number of concurrent users?
- Data volume limits?
- Frontend generation time acceptable?

**Answer:** 

doesn't matter

### Q19: How to handle caching?
- Query result caching?
- Compiled query caching?
- Frontend asset caching?
- Git operation optimization?

**Answer:** 

no caching in the poc. frontend works only with compiled queries or views.

## Operations & Deployment

### Q20: What observability features are required?
- Logging strategy across components?
- Metrics/monitoring?
- Distributed tracing?
- Audit trail requirements?

**Answer:** 

I think... console may write to a session log file (all logger outputs). probably no metrics in the poc and nothing like that. repos already contain history. lets keep it simple in the poc.

### Q21: How should configuration work?
- Environment variables vs config files?
- Runtime reconfiguration?
- Secrets management?
- Feature flags?

**Answer:** 

what are best practices? 
are you asking about console and the mcp? - what are best practices.
are you asking about ai-frontend and ai-db and git-layer - what are best practices for libs.

**AI Feedback:** Best practices:
- **Libraries (ai-db, ai-frontend, git-layer)**: Use pydantic BaseSettings - env vars with defaults, type validation, .env support
- **Apps (console, mcp)**: Hierarchical config - env vars override config files, use python-dotenv
- **API server**: Environment-specific configs (dev/prod), centralized config service later
- **Secrets**: Never in code, use env vars, consider AWS Secrets Manager/Azure Key Vault later

**User Response:**:
ok! please do follow best practices

### Q22: What high availability features are needed for POC?
- Single instance acceptable?
- Backup/restore strategy?
- Disaster recovery?

**Answer:** 

not in the poc.

## Integration Priorities

### Q23: What is the MVP feature set?
Given the current gaps, what is the minimum viable functionality for Phase 2:
- Must-have features vs nice-to-have?
- Can we defer some components (e.g., MCP servers)?
- Core user journey that must work?

**Answer:** 

basically.... console, mcp, ai-frontend, ai-db should work. git-layer too, as well. we may need an additional ai db api component. here I wanted to discuss with you, can ai-frontend use the mcp server for its read calls and update calls? I think the mcp servers are not very much intended for that. I'm not sure it'll work correctly. probably the ai-db api is good to have for the frontend to be able to work.

oh, yes, and in the future we'll include chats with ai and sessions management (of those chats) in the frontend-api. so.. suggest names for that service? ai frontend api? bff? I think bff is good. what do you think? other options?

**AI Feedback:** You're right - MCP isn't suitable for frontend HTTP calls. MCP uses JSON-RPC over stdio, not HTTP. We need a separate HTTP API server. 

**Name suggestions:**
- **ai-db-api** - Clear and specific (my preference for POC)
- **bff** (Backend for Frontend) - Good if it'll orchestrate multiple services
- **api-gateway** - If it'll route to multiple backends later

For POC, I'd start with "ai-db-api" and rename to "bff" when chat features are added.

**User Response:**:
see, it'll handle voice sessions. chat contexts. it may have an agent in it. and in the future it may also serve as an api for frontend-modification operations. but there will be no backends behind it, it'll just be a service providing the ai-db and ai-frontend functionality. for multiple frontends. and maintainig chat sessions. voices etc. even doing some update transactions. maybe regenerating frontend. naming ideas?

**AI Feedback:** Given this broader scope, here are better naming suggestions:
- **ai-hub** - Central hub for all AI operations (my preference)
- **ai-orchestrator** - Emphasizes coordination role
- **ai-platform-api** - Platform suggests multiple capabilities
- **ai-studio-api** - Studio implies creative/generative capabilities

"ai-hub" is concise and implies it's the central point for all AI-related operations.

**User Response:**:

decided! ai-hub

### Q24: What are the success criteria?
How will we know Phase 2 is complete:
- Specific demo scenarios?
- Performance benchmarks?
- Integration test coverage?
- Documentation requirements?

**Answer:** 

all tests pass, compilation works, github actions work, I'm able to do docker compose up on my host machine and everything immediately works (able to work with console, able to call the mcp, able to navigate the frontend, it shows data, it can execute some data update operations), nothing breaks in case the users requests cant be satisfied (in mcp and the console) - correct error results.

## Technical Questions (Critical for Planning)

### Q25: Async vs Sync Decision?
Git-layer is sync, everything else is async. Should we:
- Make git-layer async?
- Add sync adapters everywhere?
- Run git operations in thread pool?

**Answer:** 

all async.

**AI Feedback:** Agreed. Making git-layer async is the cleanest solution. We can use:
- `aiofiles` for file operations
- `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` for git commands
- Async context managers (`async with`)
This maintains consistency across all components.

### Q26: How to handle the Claude Code dependency?
AI-Frontend depends on Claude Code CLI which has specific system requirements:
- Docker/container strategy?
- Version pinning?
- Offline operation possible?
- Licensing considerations?

**Answer:** 

docker container. version pin - yes, lets do. offline - no. licensing - it allows such use. think about the login process, maybe manual steps needed for it to login. or if it can easily use the ambient auth from the host machine (mount some file in docker?) then thats good.

### Q27: Error handling philosophy?
- Fail fast vs graceful degradation?
what does it mean? be specific please.

**AI Clarification:** 
- **Fail fast**: Stop immediately on any error (e.g., invalid schema = abort entire operation)
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue with reduced functionality (e.g., skip failed table, process others)

For AI-DB, I recommend fail-fast for schema changes but graceful for data queries where possible.

**User Response:**:
ai-db and ai-frontend: fail fast always. only fail fast, no graceful degradation.

- User-friendly error messages from AI?
user-friendly errors are a must

**AI Concern - Error Information Loss**: AI-generated "friendly" errors often hide critical debugging info:
- "Something went wrong with your table" vs "Foreign key constraint violation on users.manager_id->users.id"
- Users can't debug without technical details
- Support requests lack necessary information

**Balance**: Show friendly message but always include technical details in expandable section or logs.

**User Response:**:
ok! in expandable section on ux. and in logs of ai-frontend-api (whatever we call it). sure.

- Retry strategies?
ai-db and ai-frontend may give a couple of retries to the model / claude code. to attempt to fix things. ai-db may even retry beginning from scratch (as it saves data only on successful validation). ai-frontend may just call the claude code a couple of times. number of retry attempts are configurable per config (best practice for python libraries).

- Circuit breakers?
where would they be mandatory?
langchain? not sure.
ai-frontend may have a timeout (configurable) for claude code calls, just in case it never returns, however I doubt it may happen. let it be default 5 minutes.

**AI Feedback:** Circuit breakers useful for:
- AI API calls (OpenAI/Anthropic) - prevent cascade failures
- Git operations under load
- Future: API server to external services

For POC, timeouts are sufficient. The 5-minute default for Claude Code is reasonable.

**User Response:**:
I don't see how circuit breakers are useful atm. in poc lets not have them.

**Answer:** 

very important questions.
please see my updates to the root claude.md (you probably already see them) - very important about error handling, i've added it.
see above.

## Additional Technical Questions Based on Code Review

### Q28: Transaction Context Interface Standardization
The git-layer provides a `Transaction` class with properties `path` and `transaction_id`, but:
- AI-DB expects `TransactionContext` with `working_directory` property
- MCP servers expect `TransactionContext` with async `write_escalation()` method
- Console tries to use git-layer's Transaction directly

Should we:
- Create a standard TransactionContext interface that all components use?
absolutely! declared in the git-layer.
not sure what you mean by 'interface'. basically..
all should depend on the git-layer, and git-layer have no dependencies.

- Build adapters for each component?
umm why? what do you mean?
the console and the mcp should call git-layer, ai-db, ai-frontend directly.
I don't think adapters are needed.

**AI Clarification:** You're right - if we standardize the interface in git-layer, adapters aren't needed. I was thinking of the current mismatch, but fixing it at the source is cleaner.

- Modify git-layer to match expected interfaces?
probably modify all, the git-layer will contain and provide the interface, other libs - switch to using it.

**Answer:** 

see above

### Q29: AI-DB Method Signatures
AI-DB's `execute()` method expects:
- `query: str`
- `permission: PermissionLevel` (enum)
- `transaction_context: Optional[TransactionContext]`
- `query_context: Optional[QueryContext]`

But the generated frontend API expects lowercase permission strings ("select", "data_modify"). Should we:
- Standardize on enums everywhere?
- Accept both formats in AI-DB?
- Transform at the API server level?

**Answer:** 

standardize

**AI Feedback:** Agreed. Use enums everywhere for type safety. The API server can handle any necessary transformations for external clients if needed.

### Q30: Schema Access Pattern
Currently unclear how components access schema:
- AI-DB stores schemas in YAML files in `data/schemas/`
- AI-Frontend needs JSON Schema format for TypeScript generation
- Console needs to fetch schema from AI-DB to pass to AI-Frontend
- No clear `get_schema()` method found in AI-DB

Should we:
- Add explicit schema API to AI-DB?
- Direct file access to schema YAML files?
- Schema service/cache layer?

**Answer:** 

interesting, frontend generates schemas. I do'nt mind.
I think the ai-db needs a get schema method.
and ai-frontend needs to consume it on init or on schema changes.
console should implement a manually called operation that brings the frontend up to date when the db schema changes.
(it also includes some input for the user, which dc-frontend will pass over to claude code).
the db schema should be provided to the ai-frontend on init on a call that of method.
ai-frontend will regenerate the typescript models, right?
and store the schema, the models, the skeleton, the files generated by claude code, and the compiled files all in its folder.

**AI Concern - Schema/Frontend Sync**: This manual update pattern is risky. Users will forget to regenerate frontend after schema changes, causing:
- Runtime errors when frontend expects old schema
- Type mismatches breaking API calls
- Forms submitting to non-existent columns

**Suggested mitigation**: 
- Add schema version checking on frontend startup
- Console shows prominent warning when schema is newer than frontend
- Consider auto-regeneration option (even if disabled by default)

**User Response:**:
no. in poc I'm the only user, I won't forget. lets not do what you suggested.

### Q31: Git Operations Thread Safety
Git-layer assumes single-threaded operation, but:
- API server will handle concurrent HTTP requests
- Multiple users might access same database
- Transactions could overlap

How should we handle:
- Concurrent transaction requests?
- Lock management for Git operations?
- Queue vs thread pool vs process pool?

**Answer:** 

concurrent read transactions are not a problem, as I explained above.
concurrent update transactions - dont worry, assume it'll never happen. for the poc.
no locks. no protection.

**AI Feedback:** OK for POC. For future reference, when we need concurrency:
- Use file-based locks (fcntl/lockfile)
- Or queue write operations (Redis/RabbitMQ)
- Or dedicated Git server with transaction queue

**AI Concern - Data Corruption Risk**: Even in POC, no write protection is dangerous:
- Two Console instances could corrupt the repository
- MCP and Console could conflict simultaneously
- API server naturally receives concurrent requests

**Minimal protection suggestion**: Add a simple file-based lock (.git/ai-db.lock) for write transactions. This is ~5 lines of code that could prevent repository corruption.

**User Response:**:
is the ai-db.lock per repository or per branch?
I don't mind a file-based lock, but I'm afraid it's per branch. then lets not do it.
if it's per repository, lets do it. it'll be acquired on a repository, right? the remote.
like... really work.
if it's more complicated - lets not do it.
if it's perfect and simple - lets do it.

**AI Clarification:** The lock would be per repository (in the main branch), not per branch. Simple implementation:
```python
# In git-layer's begin_transaction():
lock_file = Path(repo_path) / ".git" / "ai-db-write.lock"
if write_mode and not acquire_lock(lock_file):
    raise TransactionError("Another write transaction in progress")
```
This is ~10 lines total. The lock file stays in `.git/` folder so it's not tracked. Since you're OK with this simple approach, let's do it.

**User Response:**:
ok! thx

### Q32: Frontend Generation Output
AI-Frontend generates a complete React app, but:
- Where should generated code be stored?
in the folder inside the git, the folder corresponding to the ai-frontend service. together with sources, schema, ai-db's current semantic file, ai-frotnend's current semantic file (updated by claude code). ai-frontend should never access ai-db's files directly. only get the content in the action calls.
and mcp, git-layer, console should never read any files directly. just rely on ai-db and ai-frontend method calls.
sometimes they'll pass something from ai-db to ai-frontend.
- How to serve it to users?
docker nginx container
- Should it be committed to Git?
yes
- Temporary files vs persistent storage?
see above

**Answer:** 

please see above

**AI Concern - Repository Bloat**: Storing generated frontend in Git will cause:
- Massive repository size (node_modules-like generated code)
- Meaningless diffs in generated files cluttering history
- Slow clones as generated assets accumulate

**Alternative approach**: 
- Commit only source files and generation config
- Generate frontend during deployment/build
- Or use Git LFS for generated assets
- Consider .gitignore for dist/ and node_modules/

**User Response:**:
.gitignore - sure. make it in the git-layer.
bloat is ok for poc, lets not worry.

### Q33: Error Response Standardization
Different error formats across components:
- AI-DB returns `QueryResult` with `success`, `error`, `data_loss_indicator`
- Frontend expects `{success: boolean, error?: string, message?: string}`
- MCP uses MCP protocol error format
- Console has its own error display logic

Should we define a standard error format?

**Answer:** 

we should use best practices. we need to understand that we have different situations - mcp, console, python libs, typescript classes, ux errors. there are different best practices. but I guess the approach in the python libs should be more or less standard.

regarding the try-catches in code, see claude.md in the root.

### Q34: Missing HTTP Server Architecture
Since no HTTP API server exists, we need to decide:
- Should it be a separate component or part of Console?
- FastAPI vs Flask vs other framework?
- How to handle WebSocket connections for real-time updates?
- Should it also serve generated frontend static files?

**Answer:** 

I think a separate component. not sure whats better, maybe fastapi or whatever you think is better. remember in the future it'll store contexts of AI chats, maybe some langchain or something, and it'll handle voice chats as well. in the future.

serve generated files - no.
websockets - not in the poc.

**AI Concern - API Server State Management**: Direct AI-DB library usage in API server means:
- API server manages transactions and git operations
- Any crash leaves transactions hanging
- Difficult to scale horizontally later
- Memory leaks in long-running process affect git operations

**Consider for future**: Queue-based architecture where API submits jobs and workers handle git operations with proper cleanup.

**User Response:**:
correct me if I'm wrong, crashes dont leave transaction shanging. they leave temp folders hanging, but those are temp folders, it's ok. any writable transaction happen in a temp folder corresponding to a branch. and on commit they're merged to main to the main repo.

**AI Agreement:** You're absolutely right! I was overthinking this. The git-layer design is actually quite robust:
- Crashes just leave orphaned temp folders/branches (harmless)
- No transaction state to clean up
- Main branch stays clean
- Failed branches provide debugging history

This is much cleaner than I initially thought. No queue architecture needed for POC.

### Q35: Component Initialization Order
Currently each component initializes others it depends on:
- Console creates AIDB and AiFrontend instances
- MCP servers expect pre-initialized instances via dependency injection
- Who manages the git repository initialization?

What should be the proper initialization flow?

**Answer:** 

I havent looked at the code, but I think mcp and console should be completely independent, both should init the git layer, the ai-frontend and the ai-dc. with configs. following the chosen standards of config. (whats best practice in python).

## Additional Questions Based on Your Answers

### Q36: Docker-in-Docker Testing Strategy
You mentioned docker-in-docker for testing. Should we:
- Use testcontainers-python for integration tests?
- Have separate docker-compose files for testing vs production?
- Mock external services (AI APIs) or use real ones in some tests?

**Answer:**

i think have separate docker-compose for testing vs production.
they would include test commands and/or some specifically configured containers.
i want to be able to run those tests on my host machine, and I want you to be able to run them, and you're inside the .devcontainer of the vscode. and I also want the github actions and/or azure devops pipelines to run them in ci/cd.

testcontainers-python is actually also an option. if you think it's a good option - lets do it. it seems simpler.

ai apis - always mock. claude code - also mock.

**AI Feedback:** Yes, testcontainers-python is simpler and better:
- No docker-compose maintenance
- Tests are self-contained
- Works in CI/CD without extra setup
- Each test spins up only what it needs
- Automatic cleanup

Let's use testcontainers-python for integration tests.

### Q37: Git Repository Structure
For the shared repo containing both DB and frontend:
```
repo/
├── db/          # AI-DB files
├── frontend/    # AI-Frontend files
└── .git/
```
Is this structure correct? Should we have any additional directories?

**Answer:**

great!

### Q38: API Server Endpoints
Based on your answers, the ai-db-api needs:
- `POST /query` - Execute queries (with compiled plan support)
- `POST /execute` - Execute mutations
- `GET /schema` - Get current schema
What about health checks, metrics, OpenAPI docs?

**Answer:**

health, metrics - no. openapi docs - yes. get /schema - I dont think it's needed, the compiled frontend wont need it, it was already compiled with it.

/execute - lets call it db data update or db ddl or something. it will supply data update permissions.
/query - lets it call db compiled query (which may be a view or a query). or maybe have separate, for a view and for a compiled query. whatever reflects the ai-db service interface more correctly.

keep in mind this api will in the future also be able to the modify db schema (currently not used by frontend, will provide different permissions), or call frontend updates. so lets call the endpoints more specific with the future implementations in mind.

**AI Suggestion:** Based on future needs, here's a clearer endpoint structure:
```
POST /db/query          # Execute compiled queries
POST /db/query/view     # Execute named views
POST /db/data          # Data modifications (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
POST /db/schema        # Schema modifications (future)
POST /frontend/generate # Frontend generation (future)
POST /chat/message     # Chat interactions (future)
POST /voice/session    # Voice sessions (future)
```
This namespacing makes the API self-documenting and extensible.

**User Response:**:
but for now, only 
POST /db/query          # Execute compiled queries
POST /db/query/view     # Execute named views
POST /db/data          # Data modifications (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)

### Q39: Frontend Development Workflow
Since no hot reload, how should developers:
- Test UI changes during development?
manual f5
- Debug generated TypeScript code?
i hope we won't need to debug :) but when compiling, lets include debug symbols :) not sure if such a thing exists in ts/js/react/etc.
- Handle TypeScript compilation errors from Claude Code?
if typescript compilation fails, the frontend update operation will raise an error. with details. and developers wont need to handle it. they'll see the error details in console / mcp. ai-frotnend will log it. console will log it to file. they won't ever have to fix it manually - we 100% rely on claude code.

**Answer:**

see above

### Q40: Error Recovery Patterns
When git-layer cleans up after errors:
- Should it create a git stash of failed changes?
no, i said above, a new branch with failed postfix, smth like that. commit and push it. it was your suggestion. and then switch back to the prev tran branch (not main).
- Log the attempted changes somewhere?
that branch will have it.
- How to help users debug what went wrong?
that branch will have it.

**Answer:**

see above

### Q41: Component Naming Convention
We have:
- Libraries: ai-db, ai-frontend, git-layer
- Apps: console, ai-db-mcp, ai-frontend-mcp, ai-db-api
- Future: bff (when chat is added)
Should we standardize naming (hyphens vs underscores, prefixes)?

**Answer:**

hyphens, maybe no prefixes for now.

### Q42: Integration Test Scenarios
What specific scenarios should integration tests cover? For example:
- Create schema → Generate frontend → Make API call → Verify response?
- Transaction rollback with partial changes?
- Concurrent read operations?

**Answer:**

maybe I wouldn't worry about integrations tests too much now, maybe we need to test something that isnt covered by unit tests. I see some benefit in integration tests per library, library-local integration tests. they're more like unit tests though. I dont see that integration tests for the entire solution are needed. maybe we do need some. they'd mock api and claude code? hmm. think if it's easy to do. try it.

### Q43:

(added by the user)

ai-frontend and ai-db call a transaction method when an operation succeeds (to ask git-layer to commit) and call a transaction method when an operation fails (to ask git-layer to create a new -failure branch, commit, push, switch back to the old branch). because I realized the git layer won't know about successful operations, it wont know it needs to commit. but it needs to commit after every successful operation. commit to a new branch and push that new branch and go back to the transaction branch on failures. and push and merge to main and push on transaction commits. and commit to a branch called -rollback on transaction rollbacks. so ai-frontend and ai-db will call those methods on operation success/failure, and in case of failure raise an error after calling the transaction method notifying the git-layer about failure. then, if within the "with" block there's a try-catch, then the transaction will be able to continue and finally be committed at some point (or rolled back). if there's no try-catch, the exception will propagate, the "with" will know about it and rollback the transaction. so everything will work very smoothly for the libraries user. and the user has freedom to commit/rollback transactions, wrap or not wrap operations within the transaction with try-catches, and feel safe about integrity in case of failure and a catch. caught errors mean nothing was changed or committed in the current transaction branch.

### Q44:

(added by the user)

init of files of the db or of the frontend within an empty git repo: those init operations are executed by the ai-db and ai-frontend. not called but executed, as they notice their folders are empty. git-layer only creates empty folders for them, and supplies paths in the transaction object for them.

### Q45:

(added by the user)

Repository can be initialized with seed data from a folder path.
for unit tests. there has to be such methods in git-layer... I think they need to be in ai-frontend and ai-dc. like... opening a transaction, supplying a folder to take seed data from (merely copy, but validate (compile / validate) before copying; validation involves no AI calls, just a standard pre-commit validation that ai-frontned and ai-db do)

### Q46:

(added by the user)

recent decision, ai-frontend and ai-db dont depend on git-layer.
ai-shared defines the transaction protocol instead.
its important to keep ai-db and ai-frontend physically separate.
