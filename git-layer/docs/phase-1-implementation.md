# Git-Layer Phase 1 Implementation

## Overview

Git-Layer has been implemented as a Python library that provides database-style transactions (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK) using Git as the underlying engine. The library enables file-based systems to have ACID-like properties through Git's version control capabilities.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GitRepository** (`repository.py`)
   - Wrapper around GitPython for Git operations
   - Handles repository initialization, branch management, commits, merges
   - Provides crash recovery mechanisms
   - Manages temporary clones for write isolation

2. **Transaction** (`transaction.py`)
   - Implements context manager protocol for Python `with` statements
   - Manages transaction lifecycle (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK)
   - Handles write escalation to temporary clones
   - Provides `operation_complete()` for ai-db integration
   - Includes destructor for cleanup of abandoned transactions

3. **Public API** (`__init__.py`)
   - `begin()`: Start a new transaction
   - `recover()`: Recover repository to clean state
   - Exception hierarchy for error handling

## Key Implementation Details

### Transaction Flow

1. **BEGIN Phase**
   - Creates a new branch named `transaction-{uuid}-{timestamp}`
   - Validates main branch is clean (no uncommitted changes)
   - Transaction remains in original repository until write escalation

2. **Write Escalation**
   - Triggered by calling `write_escalation_required()`
   - Creates a temporary clone of the repository
   - Switches to transaction branch in the clone
   - All subsequent operations happen in the isolated clone

3. **Operation Commits**
   - `operation_complete(message)` creates a commit after each operation
   - Supports ai-db requirement for per-operation commits
   - `checkpoint(message)` also available for explicit checkpoints

4. **COMMIT Phase**
   - Commits any pending changes in clone
   - Fetches transaction branch from clone to original repository
   - Merges transaction branch to main with descriptive message
   - Cleans up temporary clone and transaction branch

5. **ROLLBACK Phase**
   - Commits current state to transaction branch (for debugging)
   - Pushes rollback state to original repository
   - Does NOT merge to main
   - Cleans up temporary clone
   - Transaction branch preserved for investigation

### Design Decisions

1. **Temporary Clones for Write Isolation**
   - Ensures original repository stays clean during transactions
   - Prevents partial states from being visible
   - Allows safe concurrent read operations

2. **Branch Naming Convention**
   - Format: `transaction-{uuid}-{timestamp}`
   - Example: `transaction-a1b2c3d4-20250105-143022`
   - Provides uniqueness and debugging information

3. **Commit Strategy**
   - Every operation can create a commit via `operation_complete()`
   - Failed transactions still commit their state (but don't merge)
   - Preserves full history for debugging and auditing

4. **Resource Management**
   - Context manager ensures proper cleanup
   - Destructor (`__del__`) handles abandoned transactions
   - Temporary clones always cleaned up
   - Old transaction branches cleaned up after 24 hours

## Integration Points

### For AI-DB

1. **File Operations**
   - AI-DB uses standard Python file I/O
   - Operates on path provided by `transaction.path`
   - No special file operation methods needed

2. **Commit Messages**
   - AI-DB provides commit messages via `operation_complete()`
   - Transaction-level message provided at `begin()`
   - Merge commits automatically formatted

3. **Error Handling**
   - Exceptions propagate naturally
   - Transaction automatically rolls back on exception
   - Failed states preserved in branches

### For AI-Frontend

- Same transaction model as AI-DB
- Can share repository with proper transaction isolation
- Frontend file operations work identically

## Assumptions Made

1. **Single-threaded Operation**
   - No locking mechanisms implemented
   - Assumes no concurrent Git operations
   - Suitable for AI-DB's single-threaded model

2. **Main Branch Name**
   - Hardcoded to "main" (not configurable)
   - Auto-creates main if doesn't exist

3. **Git User Configuration**
   - Sets default user.name and user.email if not configured
   - Uses "git-layer" and "git-layer@localhost"

4. **Repository Location**
   - Requires explicit path parameter (no defaults)
   - Auto-initializes if directory doesn't exist

## Known Limitations

1. **No Nested Transactions**
   - BEGIN fails if transaction already active
   - By design, not a technical limitation

2. **No Async Support**
   - Synchronous operations only
   - AI-DB will need to handle async separately

3. **No Transaction Status Checking**
   - No method to query transaction state
   - Relies on exception handling for state management

## Unanswered Questions

1. **Performance with Large Repositories**
   - Cloning performance not tested at scale
   - May need optimization for large repos

2. **Network Storage**
   - Behavior on network-mounted filesystems unknown
   - Git operations may have different semantics

3. **Concurrent External Git Operations**
   - No protection against external Git commands
   - Could cause conflicts despite single-threaded design

## Error Handling

1. **Repository Errors**
   - Auto-initialization on missing repository
   - Recovery method for corrupted states
   - Clear error messages for debugging

2. **Transaction Errors**
   - Automatic rollback on exceptions
   - State preserved in branches
   - Cleanup guaranteed via context manager

3. **Git Operation Errors**
   - Wrapped in GitOperationError
   - Original Git errors preserved
   - Logging for debugging

## Testing

- Comprehensive test suite with 75% code-to-test ratio
- Tests cover all transaction scenarios
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- Temporary repositories for isolated testing

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Could cache clones for repeated transactions
   - Shallow clones might improve performance

2. **Enhanced Recovery**
   - Could add more sophisticated conflict resolution
   - Automatic cleanup of old transaction branches

3. **Monitoring**
   - Could add metrics for transaction duration
   - Track clone creation/cleanup stats

## Summary

Git-Layer successfully implements all requirements for a Git-based transaction system. It provides a clean Python API that integrates seamlessly with AI-DB and AI-Frontend, maintaining data integrity through Git's version control while keeping the main branch always in a clean state.
