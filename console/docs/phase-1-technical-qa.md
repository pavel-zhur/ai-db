# Console Technical Q&A

## Architecture & Design Questions

### 1. Console Application Type
**Q:** Should this be a CLI application (using something like `click` or `typer`) or a more interactive terminal UI (using `rich`, `textual`, or `prompt_toolkit`)?
more interactive

**Q:** Should the console support multiple concurrent sessions, or is it single-user/single-session?
single

### 2. State Management & Persistence
**Q:** How should conversation history be persisted? In-memory only, local file, or database?
memory + local file output for tracing, never read back

**Q:** Should there be a session management system with session IDs, or just maintain state for the duration of the console process?
just maintain in memory

**Q:** Should the console remember previous sessions when restarted?
no

### 3. AI-DB Integration
**Q:** How should the console handle the connection to AI-DB? Should it:
- Create a new connection on startup?
n/a
- Use connection pooling?
no
- Support switching between different databases?
no

it's the library config. you'll use that library. what are best practices in python, libraries, consoles. please go with best practices.

**Q:** Should the console expose all AI-DB capabilities or a curated subset?
all

**Q:** How should we handle long-running queries? Should there be:
- Progress indicators?
yes
- Query cancellation support?
not in the poc
- Timeout configuration?
no, it's the libraries configs, not yours (however maybe you somehow have a config file from where their configs are loaded... i'm not sure whats responsiblity on that between you and them, use best practices)

### 4. AI-Frontend Integration
**Q:** When the user requests UI generation through the console, should:
- The generated UI be saved to files automatically?
if course, it's what the ai-frontend lib does
- The console provide a preview mechanism?
no
- The file paths be configurable?
no, just maybe in the configs of the git-layer lib

**Q:** Should the console support editing/refining generated UIs iteratively?
yes. not directly of course, via calls to the libs.

### 5. Transaction Management
**Q:** While Git-Layer handles transactions transparently, should the console:
- Show transaction status indicators?
it's always a transaction.. ability to commit it.. rollback..
- Provide explicit transaction commands for advanced users?
sure
- Auto-commit after each operation or batch operations?
no

**Q:** How should nested transactions be handled if a user tries to BEGIN within an existing transaction?
no nested trans, no begin option if tran open

### 6. Error Handling & Recovery
**Q:** How should the console handle:
- AI-DB connection failures?
lib will return an error, any error returned by the lib - the console should show, without interpreting
- Malformed natural language queries?
same
- Transaction conflicts?
same
- Network timeouts?
same

**Q:** Should there be a verbose/debug mode for troubleshooting?
could be. wher eyou output logger logs as well to stdout while libs work.
but it's off by default.

### 7. Output Formatting
**Q:** For table display, should we:
- Use a specific table library (like `rich.table`, `tabulate`, `prettytable`)?
whats best practice
by the way the table cells can have nested structures, our db is.. you know.. its schema is whatever json schemas standard support. maybe have an option to view json / yaml / table.
- Support different output formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)?
yup, and file too
- Have configurable column width limits?
whats best practice

**Q:** How should we handle very large result sets? Pagination? Streaming?
whats best practice

### 8. Security & Authentication
**Q:** Does the console need:
- User authentication?
no
- Role-based access control?
no
- Audit logging?
no
- Secure credential storage?
no

### 9. Configuration
**Q:** Should configuration be handled through:
- Environment variables?
- Configuration files (YAML/TOML/JSON)?
- Command-line arguments?
- All of the above with precedence rules?
whats best practice

**Q:** What configuration options should be exposed?
umm... libs.. + some yours

### 10. Testing Strategy
**Q:** Should we use:
- pytest for unit tests?
y
- Mock objects for AI-DB and AI-Frontend?
y
- Integration tests with real components?
n
- Behavior-driven development (BDD) with something like behave?
whats best practice

### 11. Packaging & Distribution
**Q:** How should the console be packaged:
- As a pip-installable package?
- As a standalone executable?
- As part of a larger distribution?
for now as a part of a larger distribution, not decided that yet

**Q:** Should it support plugins or extensions?
n

### 12. Performance Considerations
**Q:** Are there specific performance requirements for:
- Startup time?
n
- Query response time?
n
- Memory usage?
n
- Concurrent operations?
no concurrency

### 13. Logging & Monitoring
**Q:** What logging framework should be used (standard logging, structlog, loguru)?
whats best practice
but generally the console is like a cli
maybe logs written to a file by default?

**Q:** Should logs include:
- All natural language inputs?
- SQL translations?
- Performance metrics?
- Error traces?
whatever libraries wish to log
+ whatever you wish to log

### 14. Development Workflow
**Q:** Should the console support:
- Hot reloading during development?
n
- REPL-style experimentation?
i don't know what that is
- Script execution from files?
not in the poc

### 15. Dependencies
**Q:** Are there any specific library preferences or restrictions beyond what's mentioned in CLAUDE.md?
n

**Q:** Should we minimize dependencies or use best-in-class libraries for each feature?
best-in-class, but minimize. narrow. I'd say rather minimize.
